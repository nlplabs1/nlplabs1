# NLP Labs

NLP Labs' vision is to reduce human fragility using agile management systems and disruptive technologies across the globe. 

NLP Labs is a product of several years of applied, educational, and lived experiences of its founders in fragile states that are affected by conflict and climate change. NLP Labs staff are also concerned about the mounting evidence that humanity is to reach the point of no return due to the compounding effect of environmental change and conflict. 

NLP Labs aims to leverage the benefit of disruptive technologies to promote actions against fragility. We intend to follow an agile management system both as a Way of Working (WoW) and a mindset in the fight against fragility. Consequently, our products and services meet certain quality standards that include but are not limited to the following:  

* Be relevant to the society

* Must address root causes, not symptoms 

* Keep every stakeholder at the heart of everything we do

* Culturally and linguistically appropriate to the communities we serve

* Empower staff to thrive in dynamic, complex, and fragile environments

# NLP Labs develop its products and services along the following core areas.

1. The use of Massive Deep Learning Languages for automation 

2. Rapid Response Data Science

Both of the above core areas reflect the ever-changing data science landscape due to the introduction of disruptive technologies and the increasing challenges that humanity is facing. Specifically, in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, the field of data science has entered into a significantly different realm where the convergence of agility and coordinated capacity with academia, government, industry, and community organization is a must to solve pressing global issues. As such, NLP Labs work within the data science community to promote a trusted, dependable, flexible, and cohesive data-enabled rapid response network that is ready for responding to the next inevitable crisis.
